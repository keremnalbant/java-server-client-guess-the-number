# Basic game that guessing number sent by client.

## Just a basic implementation of socket lib. Developed for a school assignment. 

>>How does it works?

Server side chooses a random number in range of 1-10 then client side tries to guess the choosen number.
As client side guessed a number will send it to server. After then, server will check if number is true or not.
If it's not, server will sent a message to client as increase or decrease.
>> If client may guess the right number will win.
